# Primal Dual Formulation for Deep Learning with Constraints

This repo contains code (and data, whereever possible) used for replicating experiments in our Neurips 2019 paper: 'Primal Dual Formulation For Deep Learning With Constraints'

We applied our algorithm on three different problems: Semantic Role Labeling, Named Entity Recognition and Fine Grained Entity Typing. 
Instructions to run the code for them are in their respective folders: srl, ner and typenet.
